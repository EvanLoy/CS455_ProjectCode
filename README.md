In this study, I aimed to evaluate how effective different convolutional neural network architectures were on the PlantVillage dataset, a dataset of diseased plant leaf images and corresponding labels. I decided to test the PlantVillage data using four different convolutional neural network architectures and two different typs of data preprocessing. The rationale behind using these diverse network architectures is to explore how varying levels of complexity and regularization impact the model's ability to accurately classify plant diseases from images.
